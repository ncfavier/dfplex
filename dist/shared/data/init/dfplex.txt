This is the DFPlex config file, same syntax as DF raws.

All (keyboard) keys are given as their ASCII encoding. A value of 0 will disable that key.

(Don't forget to forward your ports if you're not playing on LAN.)

The port the static site will be served on. Players should connect to this port in their web browsers.
If this is set to 0, the static site server will not start. (You can use this to help identify
what the cause of a crash is, or to run your own static site server, e.g. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`)
[STATICPORT:8000]

The directory containing static site files to be served.
[STATICDIR:hack/www]

The port the server's websocket will listen on. Don't forget to forward your ports.
If this is set to 0, the websocket will not start. (You can use this to help identify what the cause of a crash is.)
[PORT:1234]

The max number of concurrent connections that the server will accept.
Zero means unbounded.
[MAX_CLIENTS:0]

Enable autosave while nobody is playing. You probably shouldn't use this yet.
[AUTOSAVE_WHILE_IDLE:NO]

Set this to 1 to make the game read-only when not multiplexing.
This prevents clients from using the option menus (e.g. to abandon the fortress, or escape into the title screen).
Forces MULTIPLEXKEY to 0, disabling it.
[UNIPLEX_READONLY:0]

This key toggles multiplex mode.
[MULTIPLEXKEY:92]

This key toggles client's debug output
[DEBUGKEY:124]

This key toggles server's debug output
[SERVERDEBUGKEY:0] (125)

Zoom to next client position (from default view)
[PREV_CLIENT_POS_KEY:91]
[NEXT_CLIENT_POS_KEY:93]

Pause behaviour:
    ALWAYS: if any player enters a menu, the game will pause.
    EXPLICIT: Players can only pause the game by pressing the pause key.
    EXPLICIT_DWARFMENU: like "Explicit", but the pause button can be pressed
        from any submenu in the main dwarfmode view that doesn't use the key.
        *Experimental.*
    EXPLICIT_ANYMENU: like "Explicit", but the pause button can be pressed
        from *any* menu that doesn't use the key.
        *Experimental.*
[PAUSE:EXPLICIT]

Set this to 0 to disable in-game chat.
[CHATKEY:96]

Set this to 0 to disable chat names.
[CHATNAMEKEY:126]

Set this to 0 to disable requiring a name to chat.
(If there is no key for setting a name, names will
not be required.)
[CHAT_NAME_REQUIRED:1]

Display the cursor X as text?
[CURSOR_IS_TEXT:1]

Cap on the number of keys that can be on the stack.
If this is exceeded, the stack will reset (user will be
booted to the dwarf menu.)
Set this to 0 to disable -- caveat emptor, clients could
abuse this to slow down the server.
[KEYSTACK_MAX:10000]
